Woogle Maps is a tool for structuring documents in multiple clear storylines, visualizing the relationships between them.

On the basis of a list of PDF documents as input, Woogle Maps automatically generates a TimeFlow as output.
This TimeFlow – a timeline with a graphical structure – describes the events that underlie these documents,
and attaches every document to at least one event.
Woogle Maps encompasses an extension of the original Narrative Maps algorithm created by Brian Keith Norambuena.

## Getting started

This section contains the steps that need to be taken to get started with our project and fully reproduce our results.

### Prerequisites

The project was developed using Python 3.12.3, Pip 24.0, and Poetry 1.8.2. Make sure all these are installed on your machine first.

Clone the repository with your favourite git client or using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeamEpochGithub/woogle-maps.git
```

### Installing dependencies

Run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies from `requirements.txt` using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then activate the virtual environment:

```bash
poetry shell
```

### Running the Web App

To run the web app, simply run following command:

```bash
python dashapp/app.py
```

This will start the web app on `http://localhost:8060/`.

## Google Colab

Instead of running the code locally, you can also run the code in Google Colab.
Upload the `Google Colab Preview.ipynb` file to Google Colab and run all cells.
Once all cells except the last one are done, you can access the app in the link provided at the end of Step 4.

## Pytest coverage report

To generate pytest coverage report run:

```shell
poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-branch --cov-report=html:coverage_re
```

## Documentation

The documentation is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://teamepochgithub.github.io/woogle-maps/).

Documentation is generated using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

To rebuild it, make sure to install the dependencies for generating the documentation first:

```shell
poetry install --with docs
```

Run `make html` with `docs` as the working directory. The documentation can then be found in `docs/_build/html/index.html`.

Here's a short command to make the documentation and open it in Google Chrome:

```shell
cd ./docs/;
./make.bat html; start chrome file://$PWD/_build/html/index.html
cd ../
```
